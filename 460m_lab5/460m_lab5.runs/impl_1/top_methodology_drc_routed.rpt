Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btns[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-50#1 Warning
Unrealistic path requirement between same-level latches  
There is a timing paths between the source pin u2/out_clk_reg/G and the destination pin u2/out_clk_reg/D. The two latches are positive level-sensitive with a 0ns path requirement. The 0ns path requirement is coming from the conservative latch analysis and could severely impact the runtime due to time borrowing calculation. It is not recommended to have such topology unless there is a multicycle path constraint to adjust the path requirement to a realistic value (at least half clock period).
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
